# Universal Rotation

A dynamic, priority-based spell rotation engine for Diablo IV. Automatically selects and casts spells based on configurable priorities, targeting modes, buff requirements, resource thresholds, combo chains, and stack-building sequences.

## Features

- **Priority-Based Rotation** — Spells fire in configurable priority order (1 = highest). One cast per frame with global cooldown enforcement.
- **Stack Priority Mode** — Cast a spell at override priority for N casts to build stacks, then automatically revert to normal priority. Counter resets after a configurable idle window. Works universally — no buff selection required.
- **6 Targeting Modes** — Priority (Boss → Elite → Champion → Closest), Closest, Lowest HP, Highest HP, Cleave Center (most enemies in radius), and Cursor (cast at mouse position for transport skills).
- **3 Cast Methods** — Normal (spell API), Key Press (single VK code, for evade-replacement skills), Force Stand Still + Key (hold modifier + press skill slot, for ranged melee skills like Payback/Clash).
- **Evade Aim Direction** — Key Press casts can aim toward the nearest enemy, away from it (flee/orbwalker mode), or leave the cursor as-is.
- **Combo Chains** — Casting spell A temporarily boosts spell B's priority for a configurable duration, enabling skill combos (e.g. Clash → Evade → Clash loop).
- **Buff Requirements** — Restrict a spell to only fire when the player has a specific buff active, with a minimum stack count.
- **Resource Conditions** — Cast spells only when primary resource is above or below a configurable percentage threshold.
- **Multi-Charge Tracking** — Supports spells with multiple charges and independent cooldown tracking.
- **Global & Per-Spell Min Enemies** — Global minimum enemy count that applies to all spells. Per-spell overrides also available. Bosses and Champions always bypass these limits.
- **Virtual Evade Spell** — A special non-spell entry that presses Spacebar (or any key) on a configurable priority, fully integrated with aim direction and all rotation logic.
- **Multi-Profile System** — Multiple named profiles per class with dropdown switching, new profile creation, duplication, deletion, and rename. Profiles save all global and per-spell settings.
- **Persistent Buff History** — Previously seen buffs are retained in the profile even when inactive, shown as "(Not Active)" in dropdowns so they don't disappear between sessions.
- **Town Safety** — Rotation is fully suppressed in safe zones and town areas.
- **On-Screen Overlay** — Displays equipped spells in priority order, color-coded by status (green = ready, yellow = cooldown, red = unavailable). Shows cast method, target mode, and resource condition tags.
- **Auto Movement** — Moves toward melee targets that are out of range before casting.

### Virtual Evade Spell

A special entry at the bottom of each spell list representing a raw key press (default: Spacebar). Fully supports priority, Stack Priority Mode, aim direction, and all other per-spell settings. Does not require a real spell ID and bypasses spell readiness checks.

## Multi-Profile System

Each class supports multiple named profiles. Profiles are stored as separate JSON files and tracked via a per-class manifest file.

- **Switch profiles** via the dropdown in the menu — settings update immediately
- **New Profile** — copies current settings into a new profile
- **Delete Profile** — removes the active profile (disabled when only one profile exists)
- **Rename Profile** — type a new name and click Apply
- Profiles auto-save on class change and on profile switch

## Stack Priority Mode — How It Works

Stack Priority Mode lets a spell "override" the normal rotation to build up resources or stacks before settling into steady-state behavior.

**Example — Clash/Resolve rotation:**

| Spell | Normal Priority | Stack Pri | Override Pri | Casts | Reset |
|-------|----------------|-----------|-------------|-------|-------|
| Arb | 1 | off | — | — | — |
| Buffs | 2–4 | off | — | — | — |
| Clash | 5 | ✓ | 1 | 4 | 4s |
| Evade | 6 | off | — | — | — |

- While Clash counter < 4: fires at priority 1 (overrides everything → builds stacks)
- After 4 casts: Clash reverts to priority 5
- Evade (priority 6) fires after Clash, then Combo Chain boosts Clash back to priority 1 — creating the **Clash → Evade → Clash → Evade** loop
- After 4 seconds without casting Clash (out of combat): counter resets, build phase restarts next pull

The cast counter and combo chain boost are independent — the chain boost from Evade does not reset or affect the stack counter.

## Boss & Champion Behavior

Bosses and Champions bypass **all** minimum enemy requirements (both global and per-spell). Every spell configured with `min_enemies > 0` will still fire normally against a boss or champion regardless of how many other enemies are present.

## Supported Classes

| ID | Class |
|----|-------|
| 0 | Sorcerer |
| 1 | Barbarian |
| 2 | Druid |
| 3 | Rogue |
| 6 | Necromancer |
| 7 | Spiritborn |
| 8 | Warlock* |
| 9 | Paladin |

*\*Warlock is not yet active in-game but is pre-mapped for future support.*

## How It Works

1. **Spell Scanning** — Every 2 seconds, the equipped spell bar is scanned and spell configurations are initialised or loaded from the active profile.
2. **Rotation Tick** — Each frame, spells are sorted by effective priority (accounting for Stack Priority Mode counters and active combo chain boosts), then each spell is checked in order: cooldown, readiness, resource, buffs, enemy counts, and target availability. The first spell that passes all checks is cast.
3. **Stack Priority Mode** — Effective priority is recalculated every tick by comparing the spell's cast counter against the configured target. When below target the override priority is used; at or above it the normal priority applies.
4. **Combo Chains** — After a successful cast, if a combo chain is configured, the target spell's effective priority is temporarily reduced (boosted) for the configured duration.
5. **Profile Persistence** — On class change or profile switch, the current profile is saved and the new profile is loaded. Buff history is saved per-profile so previously seen buffs remain available in dropdowns.
